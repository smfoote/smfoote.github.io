I am a husband, a father, a [Mormon](https://www.mormon.org/me/1YTB), a [web developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenmfoote), an [author](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Program-Steven-Foote/dp/0789753391/), a [runner and a cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/269149), among other things. I live in Utah County at the base of the Wasatch Mountains. I enjoy writing, not just code. This blog is a place for me to write.

### More History

I grew up in Nevada (both Reno and Las Vegas). After graduating from high school in Las Vegas, I started college at Brigham Young University in Provo, UT. After 1 year of college, I served as a missionary for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng) in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo), where I learned to speak Portuguese and eat rice and beans at every meal. What I saw and experienced in Brazil has changed me and the way I look at the world.

After my 2 year mission, I returned to my schooling at BYU, where I completed a BS and MS in Accountancy from the [Marriott School of Business](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/). While I was studying, I worked at the BYU Law Library at the circulation desk. I eventually moved to the library's information systems department, where I taught myself to program and built a couple of web applications for law school students and employees. During this time I learned Perl, C#, PHP, JavaScript, and some Python. I decided that technology is a lot of fun and I wanted it to be a big part of my career. So, I moved with my family to Silicon Valley. And became a CPA. After one year and two days working as an auditor, I moved on to _actually_ be involved in technology as a web developer at LinkedIn. I love what I do.
